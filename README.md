# Programming Survey Form - Window's Form's

This is a bootstrap template I found that I could mess around with.  This shows that I can go through a Web devlopment project and alter elements and learn concepts.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps
Alter the template

	1)  Mess around with google dev tools and change the css of certain elements
	2)  Experiment with the functionallity
	3)  Change the color theme
	4)  change some of the font
	5)  Add in some bio about myself and change some of the icons
	6)  Add in my certifications and have them open in a new page on click.

## Notes

This is basically a learning experience about what I could use boot strap 4.  I'm hoping to actually make an online resume without having to use a framework.
